 The interested
and informed citizen can congratulate himself on his lofty state of interest and
information and neglect to see that he has abstained from decision and action.
In short, he takes his secondary contact with the world of political reality, his
reading and listening and thinking, as a vicarious performance (p. 565). He
comes to mistake knowing about problems of the day for doing something
about them. His social conscience remains spotlessly clean. He is concerned.
He is informed. And he has all sorts of ideas as to what should be done. But,
after he has gotten through his dinner and after he has listened to his favored
radio programs and after he has read his second newspaper of the day, it is
really time for bed.
