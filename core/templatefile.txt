Being "shook":
	- you are disrupted very easily.
		-by others
			- lack of social experience
				- lack of awareness about signalling from individuals, and groups.
				- 
			- lack of meaning and goals
				- you overvalue others (out of fear of reprise), and undervalue yourself (no hard goals, purpose, reason to be
				more important in that moment).
			- it is a reflex for you to consider others; this is not true of people in general, or the effect is often diminished
			in them. 
		-by your own reactive mind
			- traumatic experiences. your anxiety bringing up serious but rare events which you dwell on.
