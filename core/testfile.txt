- prerequisite vs fighter pilot method:
 
 - prerequisite method:  if you feel uncertain about something, you can back off and practice inferred/or percieved skills that would help you.
 
 - fighter pilot method: just jump into it and make a lot of mistakes. The pain of uncertainty/shame/mistakes can be minimized, as everything is a skill anyways.
